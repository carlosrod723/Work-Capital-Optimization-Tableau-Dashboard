# Working Capital Optimization Dashboard Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **Working Capital Optimization** through the use of **Tableau** for analyzing receivables and payables data. The goal is to optimize liquidity by improving the management of **Accounts Payable** and **Accounts Receivable**. By leveraging **AWS RDS** to host the data and **PostgreSQL** for database management, this project enables the creation of insightful, data-driven dashboards that stakeholders can use to make informed financial decisions.

### Key Learning Outcomes:
- **Data Analysis Principles**: Understanding the steps, tools, and methodologies for data analysis.
- **Tableau Proficiency**: Using Tableau to load data from SQL Server, manipulate data types, create calculated fields, and build dynamic visualizations.
- **Working Capital Optimization**: Insight into how efficient management of short-term assets and liabilities can improve cash flow and reduce operational risks.

### Business Use Case:
Data Analysis is vital for understanding financial operations, improving efficiency, and making informed decisions. Specifically, **Working Capital Optimization** helps ensure that a company can manage its short-term financial health by balancing **Accounts Receivable** and **Accounts Payable**. This project visualizes these key financial metrics to optimize cash flow and liquidity management.

### Tech Stack:
- **Tool**: Tableau
- **Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on Amazon Web Services Relational Database Service (AWS RDS)
- **Services**: AWS RDS for database management

### Data Source

The dataset was sourced from internal databases and hosted on Amazon Web Services Relational Database Service (AWS RDS). PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database management system, was employed to create, manage, and preprocess the data tables. The dataset encompasses:

- Customer and supplier details
- Accounts receivable and payable information
- Financial metrics including invoice amounts, payment terms, and late fees

After preprocessing, the AWS RDS PostgreSQL instance was directly integrated with Tableau for advanced data visualization and analysis.
